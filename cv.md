## Indtroduction

Hello ðŸ‘‹, my name is **Vladimir** and I am frontend developer!
I am trying to build certain skills and abilities to develop fully fledged web applications. In parallel I use some backend-utilities and mobile-development technologies so in future I could become a full-stack developer.

## Experience

I have worked on three commerical products as a freelancer. Also, I have made four simple projects for my portfolio just to show what technologies and on that level I know and can practically use.
